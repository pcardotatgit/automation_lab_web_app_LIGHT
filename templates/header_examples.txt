positionned
example : let's say we have the following variable in the config.txt file : orgID=:12345678
To include the value : 123456 into the string then position the variable into the string like here under
{'roomId': DESTINATION_ROOM_ID,'markdown': message_out,'text': text_message_out,'organisation_id':'$orgID'}
